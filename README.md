## Profession Network Graph

A dynamic visualization of profession networks using graphology and Sigma.js. Nodes are color-coded based on their number of connections, with interactive search, zoom, and node focus features.

Created over a weekend after playing with the new Llama 3.2:3b LLMs locally used to generate relationships between professions, creating the core data set.
